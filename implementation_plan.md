# Implementation Plan

[Overview]  
Adjust the images in the AboutUsSection component to fit the size of the cards properly, improving visual consistency and responsiveness.

The current AboutUsSection renders cards with fixed size images that do not fully adapt to the card dimensions, potentially causing layout or visual issues. This implementation will update the image sizing and styling to ensure images fit well within the cards, maintaining aspect ratio and responsiveness. The plan includes reviewing and modifying CSS classes and inline styles, testing the visual appearance, and ensuring no regressions in layout.

[Types]  
No changes to type definitions or interfaces are required.

[Files]  
Modify the existing file appall/src/screens/Desktop/sections/AboutUsSection/AboutUsSection.tsx.

No new files will be created or deleted. No configuration files will be updated.

[Functions]  
Modify the AboutUsSection React functional component in appall/src/screens/Desktop/sections/AboutUsSection/AboutUsSection.tsx.

- Update image elements' className and style props to use responsive sizing techniques.
- Possibly replace fixed width/height with relative units or max-width/max-height.
- Ensure images maintain aspect ratio and fit within card boundaries.
- Test and adjust layout spacing as needed.

No new functions will be added or removed.

[Classes]  
No class components are used or required; no changes to classes.

[Dependencies]  
No new dependencies are required.

[Testing]  
Manual visual testing in the development environment.

- Verify images fit the card sizes properly on different screen sizes.
- Check for any layout shifts or overflow issues.
- Confirm that the cards and images maintain visual consistency and accessibility.

[Implementation Order]  
1. Modify image elements in AboutUsSection.tsx to use responsive sizing and fit card dimensions.  
2. Test the visual appearance locally on various screen sizes.  
3. Adjust styles as needed based on test results.  
4. Confirm no regressions in card layout or functionality.
